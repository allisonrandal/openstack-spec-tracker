Specification Tracking Tool for OpenStack

Inspired by the ReleaseStatus tool (retired in the Mitaka cycle), the Spec
Tracker gathers information from the OpenStack -specs repos, Launchpad, and
Gerrit, and produces static HTML that shows key themes for the release cycle,
and estimated progress toward completion of all specs for the cycle.
